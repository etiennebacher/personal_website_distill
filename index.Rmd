<!-- The postcard had a useless second scrollbar (in addition to the big one of distill). For some reason, I couldn't remove it with the CSS in custom.css. My only solution is to modify the source of the postcards::trestle template to remove this scrollbar. -->
```{r, include = FALSE}
trestles_orig <- readLines(
  system.file("pandoc_templates/trestles.html",
              package = "postcards")
)

trestles_mod <- trestles_orig

trestles_mod[
  which(
    grepl(
      'class="d-flex flex-column col px-5 align-items-center align-self-center mh-100" style="overflow-y: scroll;"',
      trestles_mod
    )
  )
] <- '<div class="d-flex flex-column col px-5 align-items-center align-self-center mh-100" style="overflow-y: none;">'

cat(paste(trestles_mod, collapse = "\n"), file = system.file("pandoc_templates/trestles.html",
              package = "postcards"))

I am a French PhD student in the [Doctoral Team Unit ACROSS](https://sites.google.com/view/fredericdocquier/xingb-blog/across) at LISER, Luxembourg. I study the relationship between cross-border mobility, attitudes and political preferences.

Besides working on this topic, I also enjoy programming with R by creating Shiny apps or packages that you can find on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/etiennebacher/). I also write blog articles about R from time to time, that you can find in the "Blog" tab above.

If you want to contact me, the best way to do so is by email at etienne.bacher@protonmail.com, or via Twitter (though I'm not very active on it).
