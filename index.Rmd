<!-- The postcard had a useless second scrollbar (in addition to the big one of distill). For some reason, I couldn't remove it with the CSS in custom.css. My only solution is to modify the source of the postcards::trestle template to remove this scrollbar. -->
```{r, include = FALSE}
trestles_orig <- readLines(
  system.file("pandoc_templates/trestles.html",
              package = "postcards")
)

trestles_mod <- trestles_orig

trestles_mod[
  which(
    grepl(
      'class="d-flex flex-column col px-5 align-items-center align-self-center mh-100" style="overflow-y: scroll;"',
      trestles_mod
    )
  )
] <- '<div class="d-flex flex-column col px-5 align-items-center align-self-center mh-100" style="overflow-y: none;">'

cat(paste(trestles_mod, collapse = "\n"), file = system.file("pandoc_templates/trestles.html",

I am a French PhD student in the [Doctoral Team Unit ACROSS](https://sites.google.com/view/fredericdocquier/xingb-blog/across) at LISER, Luxembourg. I study the relationship between cross-border mobility, attitudes and political preferences.

Besides working on this topic, I also enjoy programming with R by creating Shiny apps or packages that you can find on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/etiennebacher/). I also write blog articles about R from time to time, that you can find in the "Blog" tab above.

If you want to contact me, the best way to do so is by email, or via Twitter (though I'm not very active on it).
