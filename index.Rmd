I am a French PhD student in the [Doctoral Team Unit ACROSS](https://sites.google.com/view/fredericdocquier/xingb-blog/across) at LISER, Luxembourg. I study the relationship between cross-border mobility, attitudes and political preferences.

Besides working on this topic, I also enjoy programming with R by creating Shiny apps or packages that you can find on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/etiennebacher/). I also write blog articles about R from time to time, that you can find in the "Blog" tab above.

If you want to contact me, the best way to do so is by email at etienne.bacher@protonmail.com, or via Twitter (though I'm not very active on it).
