<!-- The postcard had a useless second scrollbar (in addition to the big one of distill). For some reason, I couldn't remove it with the CSS in custom.css. My only solution is to modify the source of the postcards::trestle template to remove this scrollbar. -->
<!-- Same for font family -->

I have recently obtained my PhD in Economics as part of the [Doctoral Team Unit ACROSS](https://sites.google.com/view/fredericdocquier/xingb-blog/across) at the Luxembourg Institute for Socio-Economic Research (LISER), Luxembourg. I focused on the relationship between cross-border mobility, attitudes and political preferences using both contemporaneous and historical data. 

I am now working as a Research Associate at LISER, helping on the INSKILL project to study the effect of Artificial Intelligence on the labour market in Western Europe.
<!-- I realized during my PhD that I prefer developing tools and creating datasets that other researchers can use rather than writing academic papers. Therefore, I am now looking for positions as a [research software engineer](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01516-2) or data scientist.  -->

In parallel, I develop or contribute to many R packages, all of which you can find on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/etiennebacher/). I also write occasional blog articles about R and I have given some training on several topics, available in the "Software" tab above.

If you want to contact me, the best way to do so is by email.
