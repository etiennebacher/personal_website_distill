This post shows how to create a gallery on a Distill website. Keep in mind that Distill is (purposely) less flexible than other tools, such as `{blogdown}`, so the gallery might look quite different from what you expect.

## Create a gallery with lightgallery.js

[Lightgallery.js](https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightgallery) is a Javascript library that allows you to build a gallery very simply. You will need images in full size and thumbnails, i.e a smaller version of the images (we will see how to automatically make them later in this post). 

First of all, let's construct the gallery with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We will see how to adapt this in R then. We need to load the Javascript and CSS files for lightgallery.js in the head:

```{html}
<head>

<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lightgallery/1.6.0/css/lightgallery.min.css" /> 
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lightgallery-js/1.4.1-beta.0/js/lightgallery.min.js"></script>

<!-- lightgallery plugins -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lg-fullscreen/1.2.1/lg-fullscreen.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lg-thumbnail/1.2.1/lg-thumbnail.min.js"></script>

</head>
```

Then, we construct the layout of the gallery. Here, I make the minimum layout, just to make sure this works:

```{html}
<div id="lightgallery">
  <a href="img1.png">
    <img src="thumb-img1.png" />
  </a>
  <a href="img2.png">
    <img src="thumb-img2.png" />
  </a>
</div>
```

As you can see, the whole gallery is in a `<div>` element. To add an image to the gallery, we just have to add an `<a>` element as the two already there.

Then, we add the Javascript code to run lightgallery.js:

```{html}
<script type="text/javascript">
  lightGallery(document.getElementById('lightgallery')); 
</script>
```

This should work, but I just add a CSS animation to zoom a bit when hovering a thumbnail:

```{html}
<style>
  #lightgallery > a > img:hover {
    transform: scale(1.2, 1.2);
    transition: 0.2s ease-in-out;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
</style>
```

That's it for the proof of concept. Now let's adapt it in R.

      </a>
      <a href="img2.png">
          <img src="thumb-img2.png" />
      </a>
    </div>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      lightGallery(document.getElementById('lightgallery')); 
    </script>
        
    <style>
      #lightgallery > a > img:hover {
        transform: scale(1.2, 1.2);

        cursor: pointer;
      }
    </style>

```

## Make the gallery with R

### Create thumbnails

First, store your (full-size) images in a folder, let's say `_gallery/img`. As we saw above, `lightgallery.js` also requires thumbnails in addition to full-size images. To automatically create these thumbnails, we can use the function `image_resize()` in the package `magick`. First, I create a function to resize a single image, and I will apply it to all the images I have:

```{r}
library(magick)
library(here)

resize_image <- function(image) {
  
  imFile <- image_read(here::here(paste0("_gallery/img/", image)))
  imFile_resized <- magick::image_resize(imFile, "6%")
  magick::image_write(imFile_resized, here::here(paste0("_gallery/img/thumb-", image)))
  
}

list_png <- list.files("_gallery/img")
lapply(list_png, resize_image)
```


### Build the HTML structure

We can now start building the HTML structure with the package `htmltools`. First, we can see that the HTML code for each image is very similar:

```{html}
<a href="img.png">
    <img src="thumb-img.png" />
</a>
```

This can be reproduced in R with:

```{r}
library(htmltools)

tags$a(
  href = "img.png",
  tags$img(src = "thumb-img.png")
)
```

We can now create a function to apply this structure to all the images we have:

```{r}
make_gallery_layout <- function() {
  
  # Get the names of all images
  images <- list.files("_gallery/img")
  
  # Get the names of all full-size images
  images_full_size <- grep("thumb", images, value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
  
  # Get the names of all thumbnails
  images_thumb <- grep("thumb", images, value = TRUE)
  
  # Create a dataframe where each row is one image (useful for
  # the apply() function)
  images <- data.frame(images_thumb = images_thumb,
                       images_full_size = images_full_size)
  
  # Create the HTML structure for each image
  tagList(apply(images, 1, function(x) {
      tags$a(
        href = paste0("_gallery/img/", x[["images_full_size"]]),
        tags$img(src = paste0("_gallery/img/", x[["images_thumb"]]))
      )
  }))
  
}
```

Lastly, we need to embed this HTML code in `<div id="lightgallery">`, as shown in the first section. We can do that with the following code:

```{r}
withTags(
  div(
    class = "row",
    id = "lightgallery",
    tagList(
      make_gallery_layout()
    )
  )
)
```

We now have all the HTML code we need. We now have to add the CSS and the JavaScript code. We can just copy-paste it in an R Markdown file.

  )
)

## Update GitHub Actions

We need to add `fs::dir_copy("_gallery/img", "_site/_gallery/img")` in GitHub Actions so that the images are found when the gallery is built. We also have to add `magick` and `httr` in the list of packages to install.

If you haven't set up GitHub Actions yet, you can check [my previous post](https://www.etiennebacher.com/posts/2021-03-19-use-github-actions-with-r-markdown-and-distill/), or check my [current GitHub Actions](https://github.com/etiennebacher/personal_website_distill/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) for this site.

## Bonus: make a gallery for #tidytuesday

I have started participating to [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) this year, and the main reason I wanted to create a gallery was to display my favorite plots. Therefore, I created a function to make it as easy as possible for me to update the plots I want to display in the gallery.

The purpose of the function below is to download a plot for a specific week in a specific year in the [repo containing my plots](https://github.com/etiennebacher/tidytuesday).

```{r}
library(httr)

get_tt_image <- function(year, week) {
  
  if (is.numeric(year)) year <- as.character(year)
  if (is.numeric(week)) week <- as.character(week)
  if (nchar(week) == 1) week <- paste0("0", week)
  
  ### Get the link to download the image I want
  req <- GET("https://api.github.com/repos/etiennebacher/tidytuesday/git/trees/master?recursive=1")
  stop_for_status(req)
  file_list <- unlist(lapply(content(req)$tree, "[", "path"), use.names = F)
  png_list <- grep(".png", file_list, value = TRUE, fixed = TRUE)
  png_wanted <- grep(year, png_list, value = TRUE)
  png_wanted <- grep(paste0("W", week), png_wanted, value = TRUE)
  # If a png file is called accidental_art, don't take it
  if (any(grepl("accidental_art", png_wanted))) {
    png_wanted <- png_wanted[-which(grepl("accidental_art", png_wanted))]
  }
  
  ### Link of the image I want to download
  origin <- paste0(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/etiennebacher/tidytuesday/master/",
    png_wanted 
  )
  
  ### Destination of this image
  destination <- paste0("_gallery/img/", year, "-", week, "-", trimws(basename(origin)))
  
  ### Download only if not already there
  if (!file.exists(destination)) {
    if (!file.exists("_gallery/img")) {
      dir.create("_gallery/img")
    }
    download.file(origin, destination)
  }
  
  ### Create the thumbnail if not already there
  thumb_destination <- paste0("_gallery/img/thumb-", year, "-", week, "-", 
                        trimws(basename(origin)))
  if (!file.exists(thumb_destination)) {
    resize_image(paste0(year, "-", week, "-", trimws(basename(origin))))
  }
 
}
```

As you can see, this function downloads the plot I want, puts it in `_gallery/img` and creates the thumbnail. All I have to do now is to choose the plots I want to display and to apply the function to these year-week pairs in the R Markdown file.

Note that for some reason, this function sometimes fails on GitHub Actions because of HTTP error 403. I think this is related to the number of requests to GitHub API but what is strange is that this function isn't supposed to make a lot of requests, so it is still a mystery.

## Conclusion

In this post, I tried to explain how to build a gallery with a simple example. However, you can also check the [repo of my website](https://github.com/etiennebacher/personal_website_distill) to have a clearer view of how to do so. I also added some CSS styling that is not described here, to limit the code to what is really necessary.

Check the [gallery](https://www.etiennebacher.com/gallery.html) to see the result.
